27	Ross-Aide Stadium	0	260	22	110	150	Nestled on the northern edge of the Purdue University campus, venerable Ross-Ade Stadium celebrates its 94th season as the home of Boilermaker football in 2017. Ross-Ade was dedicated Nov. 22, 1924, in a game against intrastate rival Indiana, which the Boilermakers won 26-7. The stadium is named for its two principal benefactors, alumni David E. Ross, former president of the Board of Trustees, and George Ade, a playwright and humorist. It was Ross who conceived the idea for the stadium and selected the site. He and Ade purchased and presented to the university the 65-acre tract on which the stadium is located. In 2006, a cold-tolerant strain of Bermuda grass was installed in Ross-Ade, making it the first Big Ten Conference stadium with such a surface. A year later, a 31-foot by 68-foot Daktronics video board was installed at the south end of Ross-Ade to significantly improve replay and other entertainment possibilities. The South End Zone Patio, which features tailgate food and beverages in an attractive 16,000-square foot area, opened in 2014 and is available to football season-ticket holders and Purdue students who are members of the Ross-Ade Brigade. The patio is a temporary addition while plans for a multi-purpose building are considered.
